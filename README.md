Microsoft R Trainings
=====================

This repository holds material for a series of webinars on Microsoft R. You may also be interested in my more advanced R course materials, available [here](https://github.com/akzaidi/R-cadence).

## Course Material

The course material for this series of webinars are available on gitbook here:

+ [MRS for Analysts](https://www.gitbook.com/book/smott/introduction-to-mrs-for-analysts/details)

## Virtual Machines

I've already configured two virtual machines with the course notebooks and the data already loaded.

+ [VM Number One](https://cogdsvm.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:8000/)
+ [VM Number Two](https://cogdsvmtwo.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:8000/)
+ [VM Number Three](https://cogdsvmthree.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com:8000/)

## Running the Labs Yourself

You can run the class labs yourself. The notebook is saved in this repository, and the data are available [here](http://alizaidi.blob.core.windows.net/training/nyctaxidata.zip). You can use either of the Azure DSVMs (Linux or Windows) to get a working version of MRS.
